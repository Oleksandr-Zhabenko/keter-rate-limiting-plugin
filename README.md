# keter-rate-limiting-plugin
Is intended to resolve the https://github.com/snoyberg/keter/issues/301 for keter. The project uses AI generated code and is intended to be used as a plugin. It is ported to Haskell from rack-attack https://github.com/rack/rack-attack (the modules Keter.RateLimiter and Keter.RateLimiter.Cache) and Ruby on Rails https://github.com/rails/rails (the module Keter.RateLimiter.Notifications) with the usage of Haskell cache package to implement caching.
